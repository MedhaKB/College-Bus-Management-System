# College-Bus-Management-System
The College Bus Management System tracks routes, student boarding, and fee status, with emergency alerts. The system includes separate admin and student pages. Admins manage data and upload notifications. Students can view their details, bus driver, coordinator, and route, and can download or print their bus pass.
